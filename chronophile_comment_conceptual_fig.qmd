I'm taking data from the Bar-On paper about relative abundance of microbes (and animals, etc) in different environments: Bar-On et al 2018 PNAS. 

Bar-On get ~10^26 "microbiome" (i.e., host-associated) cells, and ~10^30 total microbial cells (see their supplmenetal information, top of page 61.)

Thus, the total number of host-associated cells is ~0.01% of the 'environmental' cells.
